# Solving the Knapsack Problem With a Genetic Algorithm in Ruby

## Overview

The Knapsack Problem is an optimization problem in which items that have both value and weight are placed into a "knapsack" with a weight limit. The goal is to maximize the value of the items in the bucket while keeping the total weight of the items below the threshold. A maximized solution can be approximated using a genetic algorithm.
